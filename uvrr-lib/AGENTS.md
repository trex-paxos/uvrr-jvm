# UVRR-Lib: the retiring Paxos implementation

## Overview
The earlier implementation of the Paxos consensus algorithm, with exhaustive property testing. uVRR
replaces it: see `uvrr-core/AGENTS.md` and the Rust reference at `github.com/lua-lunet/uvrr-core`, which
is normative. Everything in this file describes the Paxos code that still ships here and is on its way
out, so its algorithm prose says Paxos, correctly.

The fundamental building blocks for distributed consensus, without network transport.

## Key Components

### Core Records
- **BallotNumber**: Unique proposal identifier `(counter, nodeId)`
- **Command**: Application command to replicate `(uuid, operationBytes)`
- **Accept**: Proposal message `(logIndex, ballotNumber, command)`
- **Prepare**: Leader election message `(logIndex, ballotNumber)`

### Algorithm Phases
1. **Steady State**: Leader streams accept messages, commits on majority
2. **Leader Election**: Prepare/promise exchange for slot recovery
3. **Learning**: Fixed messages notify nodes of committed values. The leader piggybacks the current
   `highestFixedIndex` on `AcceptResponse` and `PrepareResponse` messages, appends a `Fixed` message
   to each leader outbound batch, and heartbeats `Fixed` when idle. See README §"Commit-Index
   Piggybacking and Idle Fixed Announcements" and
   [Viewstamped Replication Revisited](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf) §4.1 step 6.

### Safety Invariants
- Promises apply to both prepare and accept messages
- Values chosen by majority are immutable
- New leaders recover all previously attempted slots

### Testing Strategy
- JQwik property tests exhaustively check all branches
- 1,000+ randomized network partition simulations
- Runtime safety checks throughout algorithm execution

## Usage
Implement `Journal` interface for persistence, configure cluster membership, provide application callback for chosen commands.

## Package Structure
- `msg/`: Protocol message records
- Core algorithm classes with package-private scope
- Property tests in same package as implementation
