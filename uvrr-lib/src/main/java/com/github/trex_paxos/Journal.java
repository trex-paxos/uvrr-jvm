/// The journal is the storage layer of the Paxos Algorithm. Journal writes must be crash-proof (disk flush or equivalent).
///
/// When an empty node is fist created the journal must have a `NoOperation.NOOP` accept journaled at log index 0.
/// It must also have the nodes progress saved as `new Progress(noteIdentifier)` which defaults to the minimum ballot number. .
///
/// If you are already using a relational database you can use it to store the state of the journal in two countVotes tables.
/// The `progress` table will have one row. The accept table will have a row for each `accept` message.
///
/// If you use a store that does not support transactions when the [TrexEngine] will call {@link #sync()} and you must
/// make the state crash durable in the following order:
///
/// 1. All `accept` messages in the log must be made crash durable first.
/// 2. The `progress` record is made crash durable last.
///
/// If you are using a store that supports transactions you can commit your application writes in the same transaction
/// as the journal writes. SUse the {@link TrexEngine} constructor with the `hostManagedTransactions=true` flag set to true.
/// This will prevent the TrexEngine from calling the [#sync()] method. You then must commit the database transaction after
/// *every* call to [TrexEngine#paxos(java.util.List)] and before any messages are transmitted to the network. When that
/// method return fixed results you can apply the results to your database and then commit the transaction. Once again
/// this must happen before ending any messages to the network.
///
/// It is important to note you should not delete `accept` messages the moment they are up-called into the application.
/// They should be kept around so that other nodes can request retransmission of missed messages. To
/// keep the database size under control you can run a cronjob that reads the {@link Progress#highestFixedIndex()}
/// from all databases and take the min id. You can then delete all `accept` messages from all nodes that are at a
/// lower log slot index.
///
/// VERY IMPORTANT: If you get errors where you don't know what the state of the underlying journal has become you should call
/// [TrexEngine#crash()] and restart the process.
///
/// If you want to clone a node to create a new one you must copy the journal and the application state. Then update
/// the journal state to have new node identifier in the progress record. This is because the journal is node specific,
/// and we must not accidentally mix the identity of the node when moving state between physical hosts.
